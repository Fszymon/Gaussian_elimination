**Project Description:**

This project focuses on solving a system of linear equations using the Gaussian elimination method and visualizing the results using plots.

1. **Gaussian Elimination Method:**
   - The project implements the Gaussian elimination algorithm in Python. This algorithm is used to solve systems of linear equations by transforming the coefficient matrix into row echelon form and further reducing it to upper triangular form.
   - The implementation includes checking the determinant of the coefficient matrix before proceeding to solve the equations to ensure that the system has a unique solution.

2. **Visualization of Solutions:**
   - After obtaining the solution, the project utilizes the matplotlib library to visualize the lines representing individual equations and their intersections, which correspond to the solutions of the system of equations.
   - Visualization facilitates easy understanding of where the lines intersect graphically, corresponding to the values of variables that satisfy the system of equations.

3. **Input Data:**
   - The project takes the coefficient matrix `a` and the vector of constants `b` as input, which define the system of equations. The user can customize these input data according to their requirements to solve different systems of equations.

4. **Solutions:**
   - After performing the calculations, the project presents the solutions of the system of equations, which can be used for further analysis or computations.

**Requirements:**
- The coefficient matrix must be a 3x3 matrix, as the model is specifically designed to solve systems of equations with three equations and three unknowns.

This project not only allows for effective solving of systems of linear equations but also provides an intuitive visualization of the results, making it easier to understand their significance. It can be used for various applications where solving problems in mathematics, engineering, natural sciences, and other fields is required.
